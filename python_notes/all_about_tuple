#theory with example for tuple data type

1] Introduction:

A tuple is an ordered collection of values.

Tuples are a lot like lists:

Tuples are ordered – Tuples maintains a left-to-right positional ordering among the items they contain.
Accessed by index – Items in a tuple can be accessed using an index.
Tuples can contain any sort of object – It can be numbers, strings, lists and even other tuples.

except:

Tuples are immutable – you can’t add, delete, or change items after the tuple is defined.


2] Create a Tuple:

You can create a tuple by placing a comma-separated sequence of items in parentheses ().

Example:

# A tuple of integers
T = (1, 2, 3)

# A tuple with mixed datatypes
T = (1, 'abc', 1.23, True)

# An empty tuple
T = ()
>>> type(T)
<class 'tuple'>

>>> t = (4) #even if sysntax is of tuple still it's will return type as int for that u need to place "," after that see following eg.
>>> type(t)
<class 'int'>

>>> a = (4,)
>>> type(a)
<class 'tuple'>

#so to create tuple what trully matters that is only " , " if u not specifiey parenthisys still it will work.
>>> b = 10, 20.3, True, "kanad"
>>> type(b)
<class 'tuple'>
